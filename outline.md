* Tdd Not About Testing
 * Design vs. Tests
 * Double Entry Bookkeeping
 * Myth of 100% coverage
 * Learning Form / Martial Arts
* Three Rules of TDD
 * Rule 1
 * Rule 2
 * Rule 3
 * Why these rules?
 * Why you can't break these rules
* Red, Green, Refactor Cycle
 * Diagram Flow (recycling-like diagram)
 * Refactor code AND tests
 * "What's the next most important thing..."
* Live TDD Kata
 * Bowling or FizzBuzz or ???
 * TDD Ping/Pong pairing demo
* What to test?
 * What not to test (framework, 3rd party libs)
 * Being pragmatic
 * implicit vs. explicit
 * deleting tests
 * writing already passing tests
* TDD and Legacy Code
 * Adding a test harness
 * Isolating units
 * Refactoring vs. Moving Shit Around
 * Example from working with legacy code book (pinning? / known output? / approval tests?)
* Stubbing and Mocking
 * "test double" vs. "mock"
 * faking vs. stubbing vs. spying vs. mocking
 * external services
 * isolating the system under test
 * don't mock
 * goos/outside in
 * example: testing network service (PyAuth)
 * example: legacy (Some java crap)
* Where do I start?
 * easiest: writing new code
 * harder: changing existing code
 * hardest: 100% coverage
 * Issues with TDD in brownfield vs. greenfield
* Transformation Priority Premise
 * what is TPP?
 * example: slides with tpp flow
 * Feels hard to test means something is wrong
